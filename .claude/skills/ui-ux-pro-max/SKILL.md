description: "UI/UX design intelligence for web, mobile, and desktop. This skill should be used when designing, building, reviewing, or fixing interfaces, including pages, components, design systems, accessibility, interaction, responsive layout, typography, color, charts, and stack-specific UI implementation. Curated from nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill (markdown rules only — the upstream project's Python search CLI and CSV databases were intentionally not vendored into this repo)."

# UI/UX Pro Max - Design Intelligence

Curated UI/UX rule reference distilled from [nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill](https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill) (MIT). Only the static markdown guidance was kept — the upstream project's `search.py` CLI, CSV palette/font/icon databases, and design-system generator require Python and are out of scope for this pnpm/Node-only repo, so read `references/quick-reference.md` and `references/pro-rules.md` directly instead of querying a search tool.

## When to Apply

Use this Skill when the task involves **UI structure, visual design decisions, interaction patterns, or user experience quality control**: designing new pages, creating/refactoring UI components, choosing color/typography/spacing/layout systems, reviewing UI for UX/accessibility/consistency, implementing navigation/animation/responsive behavior, or improving perceived quality and usability.

Skip it for pure backend logic, API/database design, non-visual performance work, infrastructure/DevOps, or non-visual scripts — unless the task changes how something **looks, feels, moves, or is interacted with**.

## Rule Categories by Priority

_Follow priority 1→10 to decide which category to focus on first. The full rule text for every category lives in `references/quick-reference.md` — read it on demand rather than loading it every time._

| Priority | Category            | Impact   | Domain                | Key Checks (Must Have)                                                | Anti-Patterns (Avoid)                                                        |

## Common Problems → Where to Look

The upstream project's search CLI and design-system generator (Python, CSV databases of styles/colors/fonts/stacks) are not part of this vendored copy — this repo has no Python toolchain. Use the priority table above and the two reference files directly instead:

| Problem                        | Where to Look                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dark mode contrast issues      | `references/quick-reference.md` §6: `color-dark-mode` + `color-accessible-pairs`                    |
| Animations feel unnatural      | `references/quick-reference.md` §7: `spring-physics` + `easing` + `exit-faster-than-enter`          |
| Form UX is poor                | `references/quick-reference.md` §8: `inline-validation` + `error-clarity` + `focus-management`      |
| Navigation feels confusing     | `references/quick-reference.md` §9: `nav-hierarchy` + `bottom-nav-limit` + `back-behavior`          |
| Layout breaks on small screens | `references/quick-reference.md` §5: `mobile-first` + `breakpoint-consistency`                       |
| Performance / jank             | `references/quick-reference.md` §3: `virtualize-lists` + `main-thread-budget` + `debounce-throttle` |

## Before Delivering App UI

Read `references/pro-rules.md` and run through its canonical Pre-Delivery Checklist. It covers icon/visual-element discipline, interaction feedback, light/dark contrast, safe-area layout, and accessibility — scoped to native/mobile app UI (iOS/Android/React Native/Flutter).
